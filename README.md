  MAJOR CHANGES:
  A) the ships now hold an array of ints which are the indexs on the board of the blocks it holds. This negates any need to pass by reference and simplifies the code
  B) the user now must input the size of ships they want as a string such as 234.. we need to find a way for them to enter 2 3 4 or something more friendly
  
  
  
  
  TO DO:
  ---------------
  1. allow user to place ships on board
  2. if the don't like placement let them re-choose location
  3. Assign blocks to board and ships
  4. Work on game play-- who starts how do we have players etc
  5. debug--- EDGE CASES: what happens if your ship won't fit on board? if you want too many ships?
  
  
  
  Final Proj YAY!!
